//Q12  Greetings: Using the array from Exercise 11. Instead of just printing each pers
// onâ€™s name, printing a message to them. The message will be the same for each person, but 
// personalized with their name.

 let names: string[] = ["Ahmed", "Ahsan", "Farhan"];
for (let name of names) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}, would you like to learn some TypeScript today?`);
}
